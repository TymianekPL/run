# run:// protocol

Have you ever wondered why can't you run programs from your browser? Don't worry! We've got you covered! Now, with this simple program you can run **anything you want** directly from your browser! Just either build from source or download pre-built files and run the installer (run_installer.exe), and type `run://your program` in the browser, for instance `run://cmd`. 

### How it works
This program copies the executable `run.exe` to the specified directory (prompted by the installer), and registers URL registry keys inside `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`! Simple as that!
